A technical blog focusing on C++ programming, performance optimization, and algorithms by Adam Pelc.

## About

This blog explores the deeper aspects of C++ programming, with particular emphasis on:

- **Concurrency & Memory Models** - Understanding memory ordering, atomics, and thread synchronization
- **Performance Engineering** - Lock-free data structures, optimization techniques, and benchmarking
- **System Programming** - CPU governors, hardware interaction, and low-level optimizations
- **Algorithms & Data Structures** - Efficient implementations and practical analysis
